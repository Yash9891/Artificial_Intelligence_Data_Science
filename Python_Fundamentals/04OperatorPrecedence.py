Operator Precendence
Operators have a priority i.e there is a specific order in which operations are to be
performed in case we have multiple operators in the same expression. The order is
as follows:
not
• () - Parentheses (highest priority)
• ** - Exponent
• +x, -x, ~x - Unary operators
• / // % - Multiplication, division, floor, modulus
• + - - Addition, subtraction
• << >> - Bitwise shifts
• & - Bitwise AND
• ^ - Bitwise XOR
• | - Bitwise OR
• Comparison operators - <, <=, >, >=, !=, ==
• not
• and
• or
• Assignment operators - =, +=, -= ...
